My first article on Medium! In this piece, I explain custom validation using NestJS and how to integrate it with a database. While working with the NestJS framework, I encountered a challenge: validating requests for an array that could either contain new document objects (which I validate based on specific criteria) or existing MongoDB ObjectIDs. After some research and practice, I think that I found an effective solution for that case.
