## Medium Article

My article on Medium. In this piece, I explain custom validation using NestJS and how to integrate it with a database. While working with the NestJS framework, I encountered a challenge: validating requests for an array that could either contain new document objects (which I also validate based on another DTO) or existing MongoDB ObjectIDs. After some research and practice, I think that I found an effective solution for that case.
